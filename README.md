This is project is designed to be a simple, low-cost alternative to professional swim league management software. It is designed for and activly used by the YMCA of Coastal Georgia's summer swim league.
Currently, functionality is limited to generating heat sheets in a hard-coded event format. Entries are submitted as a .csv which follows a specific format. The event order can be modified with an intermediate knowledge of Python.

Active projects include:
  - Improving documentation
  - Entry generation GUI (MATLAB)

Future projects include:
  - Meet scoring GUI
  - Times database
  - PDF formating improvements
  - Report generation

Please feel free to reach out to me directly if you have any questions about my code or want to contribute to developement. I'm by no means a software developer and write code like a mechanical engineer, so please efficiency and pretty code are not a priority.
